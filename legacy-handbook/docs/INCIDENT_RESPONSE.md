# Incident Response Guide

**Rapid response framework for P0 critical issues and production incidents.**

## üö® P0 Incident Definition

A P0 (Critical) incident is any issue that:
- **Production Down**: Complete system or major service unavailable
- **Data Loss**: Actual or imminent data corruption/loss
- **Security Breach**: Active exploitation or vulnerability
- **Revenue Impact**: >$10K/hour or critical business transaction failure
- **User Impact**: >50% of users affected with no workaround

## üî• Immediate Response Protocol

### Minute 0-5: Detection & Declaration

```bash
# 1. Create P0 issue immediately
make backlog-add type=bug title="[P0] Production API Down" severity=P0 \
  desc="API returning 500 errors for all requests since 14:30 UTC"

# 2. Trigger AI triage for root cause analysis
make backlog-triage issue=BUG-P0-YYYYMMDD-HHMM

# 3. Interrupt current sprint
make backlog-assign issue=BUG-P0-YYYYMMDD-HHMM sprint=current
```

### Minute 5-15: Initial Assessment

**AI Triage Output Review**:
The AI triage will provide:
- **Probable root causes** ranked by likelihood
- **Investigation steps** prioritized by impact
- **Similar historical incidents** for reference
- **Recommended team members** to involve
- **Mitigation suggestions** based on patterns

**Human Actions**:
1. **Confirm impact scope** (users, regions, services)
2. **Establish war room** (Slack channel, video call)
3. **Assign incident commander** (owns coordination)
4. **Begin investigation** following AI suggestions

### Minute 15-30: Mitigation

**Mitigation Priority**:
1. **Stop bleeding**: Prevent further damage
2. **Restore service**: Even if degraded
3. **Preserve evidence**: For root cause analysis
4. **Communicate status**: To stakeholders

**Common Mitigations**:
```bash
# Rollback deployment
make deploy-rollback version=previous

# Scale resources
make infra-scale service=api replicas=10

# Enable circuit breaker
make feature-flag name=circuit-breaker state=on

# Redirect traffic
make traffic-redirect from=primary to=backup
```

## üìä Incident Severity Classification

### P0 - Critical (Immediate Response)
- **Response Time**: 15 minutes
- **Resolution Target**: 4 hours
- **Sprint Impact**: Immediate interruption
- **Communication**: Executive + Customer notification
- **Post-Incident**: Mandatory RCA within 48 hours

### P1 - High (Same Day)
- **Response Time**: 4 hours
- **Resolution Target**: 24 hours
- **Sprint Impact**: Uses 20% reactive capacity
- **Communication**: Team + Management notification
- **Post-Incident**: RCA if customer-facing

### P2 - Medium (Next Sprint)
- **Response Time**: 2 days
- **Resolution Target**: 1 sprint
- **Sprint Impact**: Next sprint planning
- **Communication**: Team notification
- **Post-Incident**: Optional retrospective

### P3 - Low (Backlog)
- **Response Time**: 1 week
- **Resolution Target**: Best effort
- **Sprint Impact**: Backlog queue
- **Communication**: Tracked in backlog
- **Post-Incident**: None required

### P4 - Trivial (Nice to Have)
- **Response Time**: Best effort
- **Resolution Target**: If convenient
- **Sprint Impact**: Consider parking lot
- **Communication**: None required
- **Post-Incident**: None

## üéØ Incident Commander Responsibilities

### During Incident
1. **Own coordination** - Single point of decision
2. **Direct resources** - Assign tasks to team members
3. **Manage communication** - Updates every 30 minutes
4. **Make decisions** - Including service degradation
5. **Track timeline** - Document key events and decisions

### Communication Template
```markdown
**[TIME] Status Update**
- **Current State**: [Service up/down/degraded]
- **Impact**: [% users, regions, features affected]
- **Root Cause**: [Known/Under investigation]
- **Actions Taken**: [What we've done]
- **Next Steps**: [What we're doing]
- **ETA**: [Best estimate or "TBD"]
```

## üìù Post-Incident Process

### Within 24 Hours
```bash
# Create RCA document
make incident-rca issue=BUG-P0-YYYYMMDD-HHMM

# Schedule RCA meeting
make meeting-schedule type=rca issue=BUG-P0-YYYYMMDD-HHMM
```

### RCA Document Structure
1. **Executive Summary** (1 paragraph)
2. **Impact Assessment** (users, duration, revenue)
3. **Timeline of Events** (minute-by-minute)
4. **Root Cause Analysis** (5 Whys)
5. **Contributing Factors** (what made it worse)
6. **What Went Well** (effective responses)
7. **What Went Poorly** (gaps and failures)
8. **Action Items** (prevent recurrence)
   - **P0 Actions**: Must fix before next release
   - **P1 Actions**: Should fix within sprint
   - **P2 Actions**: Backlog for consideration

### Tracking Prevention
```bash
# Create prevention tasks from RCA
make task-create title="Add monitoring for API latency" \
  feature=monitoring decision=ADR-XXX points=5 \
  owner=@sre-team prio=P0

# Track in feature
make feature-create name=incident-prevention-YYYYMMDD \
  owner=@incident-commander stage=approved
```
