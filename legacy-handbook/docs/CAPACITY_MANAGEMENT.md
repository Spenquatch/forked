# Capacity Management Guide

**Strategic framework for balancing planned work with reactive needs using the 80/20 allocation model.**

## üéØ Core Philosophy

### The 80/20 Principle
- **80% Planned Work**: Predictable, committed deliverables
- **20% Reactive Work**: Urgent issues, opportunities, and discoveries

This split acknowledges reality: no sprint goes exactly as planned, but most work should be predictable.

## üìä Capacity Calculation

### Base Formula
```
Total Capacity = Team Size √ó Days √ó Focus Factor √ó Velocity

Where:
- Team Size = Number of developers
- Days = Working days in sprint (typically 5)
- Focus Factor = Productive hours ratio (typically 0.6-0.8)
- Velocity = Historical story points per person per day
```

### Example Calculation
```
Team: 4 developers
Sprint: 5 days
Focus Factor: 0.7 (accounting for meetings, context switching)
Velocity: 2 points/person/day

Total Capacity = 4 √ó 5 √ó 0.7 √ó 2 = 28 story points

Planned Work (80%) = 28 √ó 0.8 = 22 points
Reactive Work (20%) = 28 √ó 0.2 = 6 points
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Capacity Allocation

### 80% - Planned Work

#### What Goes Here
- **Release features**: Committed roadmap items
- **Scheduled improvements**: Planned refactoring
- **Technical debt**: Scheduled paydown
- **Documentation**: Planned updates
- **Testing**: Test coverage improvements

#### Planning Process
```bash
# During sprint planning
make sprint-plan

# Review release commitments
make release-status

# Select features for sprint
make feature-list stage=approved

# Create tasks with story points
make task-create title="..." feature=X decision=Y points=8
```

#### Commitment Strategy
1. **Core Features** (60% of planned capacity)
   - Must-have for release
   - Dependencies for other work
   - Customer commitments

2. **Important Features** (30% of planned capacity)
   - Should-have for release
   - High value improvements
   - Technical debt paydown

3. **Stretch Goals** (10% of planned capacity)
   - Nice-to-have features
   - Optimizations
   - Developer experience

### 20% - Reactive Work

#### What Goes Here
- **P0 Issues**: Production emergencies
- **P1 Issues**: High-priority bugs
- **Urgent Requests**: Time-sensitive opportunities
- **Discoveries**: Issues found during development
- **Support**: Customer escalations

#### Management Strategy
```bash
# Monitor reactive capacity usage
make sprint-capacity-status

# Check incoming issues
make backlog-list severity=P0,P1

# Assign to reactive capacity
make backlog-assign issue=BUG-P0-XXX sprint=current capacity=reactive
```

#### Overflow Handling
When reactive work exceeds 20%:

1. **Immediate (P0)**:
   - Drop stretch goals first
   - Defer important features if needed
   - Protect core features if possible

2. **Urgent (P1)**:
   - Negotiate scope reduction
   - Move to next sprint if possible
   - Request additional resources

3. **Important (P2)**:
   - Queue for next sprint
   - Bundle with related work
   - Add to backlog

## üìà Capacity Patterns

### Sprint Types & Allocation

#### Innovation Sprint
- **Planned**: 90% (new features, experiments)
- **Reactive**: 10% (minimal support)
- **When**: Early in release cycle

#### Stabilization Sprint
- **Planned**: 60% (bug fixes, polish)
- **Reactive**: 40% (issue resolution)
- **When**: Before major release

#### Standard Sprint
- **Planned**: 80% (normal development)
- **Reactive**: 20% (typical issues)
- **When**: Most sprints

#### Support Sprint
- **Planned**: 40% (critical fixes only)
- **Reactive**: 60% (customer issues)
- **When**: After major incidents

### Team Patterns

#### Senior-Heavy Team
```
Capacity Multiplier: 1.2x
Planned: 85% (can handle complexity)
Reactive: 15% (efficient problem solving)
```

#### Junior-Heavy Team
```
Capacity Multiplier: 0.8x
Planned: 75% (need more buffer)
Reactive: 25% (more discoveries)
```

#### Mixed Team
```
Capacity Multiplier: 1.0x
Planned: 80% (standard)
Reactive: 20% (standard)
```

## üîÑ Dynamic Adjustment

### Weekly Capacity Review
```bash
# Monday - Sprint Start
make sprint-capacity-check
# Allocate initial 80/20

# Wednesday - Mid-Sprint
make sprint-capacity-status
# Adjust if reactive exceeding 20%

# Friday - Sprint End
make sprint-capacity-report
# Analyze actual vs planned
```

### Adjustment Triggers

#### Increase Reactive Allocation
- Multiple P0/P1 issues pending
- Customer escalations increasing
- Technical instability detected
- Post-release bug reports

#### Decrease Reactive Allocation
- Stable system metrics
- Low issue inflow
- Strong test coverage
- Mature codebase

## üìä Capacity Metrics

### Tracking Metrics
```bash
# Real-time capacity
make capacity-dashboard

# Historical analysis
make capacity-trends period=quarter
```

#### Key Metrics
1. **Planned vs Actual**: How accurate are estimates?
2. **Reactive Overflow**: How often exceed 20%?
3. **Velocity Trend**: Getting faster or slower?
4. **Focus Factor**: How much time is productive?

### Health Indicators

- Planned work: 75-85% complete
- Reactive work: 15-25% of time
- Velocity: Stable or improving
- Team morale: High

#### üü° Stressed Capacity
- Planned work: 50-75% complete
- Reactive work: 25-40% of time
- Velocity: Declining
- Team morale: Medium

#### üî¥ Overloaded Capacity
- Planned work: <50% complete

- P2+ issues wait for planned capacity
- Triage considers available capacity

### With Parking Lot
- Promoted items need capacity allocation
- Consider capacity when promoting
- Innovation sprints from parking lot items

### With Release Planning
- Release capacity = Sum of sprint capacities
- Account for capacity variations
- Build buffer into release timeline
