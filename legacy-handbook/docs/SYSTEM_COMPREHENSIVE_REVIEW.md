# Project Handbook System Review

## Purpose of This Document
This review summarizes the Project Handbook ecosystem after auditing the evolved Postgres-first platform. It captures how deterministic workflows, lifecycle conventions, automation, and planning artifacts translate into database schemas, services, and user experiences so future enhancements can build on a shared understanding of the baseline system.

## Platform Topology & Canonical Domains
- **Roadmap Domain** â€“ Strategic initiatives are represented as structured rows with lifecycle stages, success metrics, and dependency links into releases and features. Historical revisions are tracked through temporal tables rather than file diffs.
- **Release Management** â€“ Releases coordinate multiple sprints and features with readiness checklists, risk flags, and milestone tracking stored in relational tables.
- **Sprint Operations** â€“ Weekly execution windows capture committed capacity, planned vs reactive allocation, task rosters, and retro summaries inside Postgres views and text columns.
- **Task Execution** â€“ Tasks carry status enums, story points, dependency graphs, acceptance details, and execution logs. Agents and humans update the same authoritative records.
- **Backlog & Parking Lot** â€“ Interrupt work (P0â€“P4) and long-range ideas share severity/stage governance; prioritization logic is encoded in views and trigger-enforced constraints.
- **Decision Records** â€“ ADRs and FDRs live as normalized decision entities with supersession chains, impacted scopes, and searchable narrative text stored alongside structured metadata.
- **Telemetry & Status** â€“ Snapshots, burndown metrics, and health indicators are materialized through analytics tables that power dashboards and notifications without relying on generated documents.

## Deterministic Lifecycle (DECIDE â†’ PLAN â†’ EXECUTE â†’ REPORT â†’ VALIDATE â†’ CLOSE)
1. **Decide** â€“ ADRs/FDRs set guardrails before implementation begins. Stored procedures ensure prerequisites are satisfied before downstream work starts.
2. **Plan** â€“ Capacity calculations and work selection occur via transactionally safe APIs that instantiate sprint scopes, enforce the 80/20 policy, and generate initial tasks.
3. **Execute** â€“ Agents and humans update tasks, log blockers, and adjust priorities. Status progression (`todo â†’ doing â†’ review â†’ done`) is validated through state transition tables.
4. **Report** â€“ Real-time dashboards pull from analytics tables to show health indicators (ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´), burnup/burndown, and dependency risk.
5. **Validate** â€“ Validation routines and stored checks ensure dependencies, acceptance criteria, and policy compliance before sprint closure.
6. **Close** â€“ Sprint closure APIs capture retrospectives, velocity metrics, and feed learnings into release plans.

## Automation Surface (Services & Tools)
- **Daily Cadence** â€“ Scheduler jobs run status refreshers, backlog scans, and health notifications, leveraging CLI/MCP tools that operate directly against Postgres.
- **Sprint Operations** â€“ Automated routines support planning, status refresh, burndown generation, and closure workflows while respecting transactional integrity.
- **Feature Lifecycle** â€“ Feature creation, status adjustments, and readiness checks are exposed through service endpoints with audit logs.
- **Roadmap & Release Management** â€“ Tools orchestrate roadmap curation, release alignment, and risk reviews using the same gated permissions and validation surfaces.
- **Parking Lot Governance** â€“ Quarterly review, promotion, and archival flows are encoded as stored procedures and automation jobs with approval steps surfaced in the UI.
- **Backlog System** â€“ Severity classification, AI-driven triage, and sprint assignment operate through direct database updates guarded by policies and rule evaluators.
- **Quality Gates** â€“ `validate`, `check-all`, and scenario test harnesses run as orchestrated jobs to uphold schema integrity and lifecycle compliance.

## Embedded Policies & Conventions
- **80/20 Capacity Rule** â€“ Planning endpoints enforce the split between planned and reactive work.
- **Severity Handling** â€“ P0/P1 interrupts trigger escalation workflows, notifications, and sprint health recalculation.
- **Story Points & Fibonacci Scale** â€“ Planning algorithms depend on consistent point values stored in enumerations.
- **Task Dependencies** â€“ Constraint checks prevent work from advancing until prerequisites are complete.
- **Working Calendars** â€“ Automation honors non-working days using calendar tables with override capabilities.
- **Structured Content** â€“ JSONB schemas and text columns maintain machine-readable and human-readable context without relying on standalone documents.

## Operational Telemetry & Reporting
- **Daily Status Views** â€“ Queryable projections supply yesterday/today/blockers summaries for UI display and messaging.
- **Sprint Dashboards** â€“ Aggregated metrics surface health indicators, velocity trends, and outstanding blockers in real time.
- **Burndown & Burnup Charts** â€“ Analytics tables feed visualization services that render progress trajectories.
- **Feature & Release Listings** â€“ APIs provide execution progress linked to strategic initiatives and readiness assessments.

## Governance & Safety Nets
- **Validation First** â€“ Transactional guards, triggers, and scenario tests catch missing data, dependency issues, or inconsistent states.
- **Schema Enforcement** â€“ JSONB validation, enum constraints, and naming standards prevent structural entropy.
- **Interrupt Handling** â€“ Explicit triage workflows for P0 incidents, including AI-assisted summaries and automatic escalation to stakeholders.
- **Quarterly Reviews** â€“ Automated reminders and workflow steps ensure long-term initiatives are curated and actionable.

## Integration Readiness
- Service contracts and domain events make the platform friendly to integrations with chat, CI/CD, or external trackers.
- CLI and MCP clients consume the same APIs used by agents, guaranteeing deterministic outcomes across automation surfaces.
- Documentation of lifecycle expectations, capacity rules, and gating logic remains aligned with database-backed implementations.

## Key Takeaways for Future Work
- The system is now a mature, database-centric execution platform with clear governance and extensibility, making it a strong foundation for further AI enhancements.
- Any new capabilities must preserve deterministic validations, severity-based gating, and the lifecycle semantics described here.
- Automation already encodes core business logic; future efforts should focus on orchestration, telemetry depth, resilience, and richer human oversight experiences.
