# Status: Overlay Infrastructure

## Summary
Worktree path relocation landed along with branch reuse safety. Remaining effort focuses on validating rebuild idempotence and instrumenting smoke tests.

## Milestones
- [ ] Resolve default worktree root to sibling `.forked-worktrees/`
- [ ] Reuse existing overlay worktrees and hard-reset before replay
- [ ] Cherry-pick full patch ranges with auto-continue biasing
- [ ] Add smoke test script that exercises rebuild and guard in CI

## Metrics
- Coverage: pending manual verification
- Confidence: medium (needs coordinated smoke run)

## Next Steps
1. Wire quick smoke checklist into sprint validation
2. Capture rebuild timing + conflict metrics for release notes
3. Close out residual TODOs in `build_overlay` comments (if any)
