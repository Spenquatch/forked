# Status: Release Operations

## Summary
README updates, quick smoke checklist, and release checklist are merged. Planning docs in legacy handbook are being refreshed (this task).

## Milestones
- [ ] Document smoke + release checklists in README
- [ ] Update CI workflow to editable install
- [ ] Add backlog for nice-to-haves (`forked clean`, `status --json`)
- [ ] Finalize planning docs (release, sprint, tasks) aligned with README

## Next Steps
1. Capture final decision log / ADR if needed.
2. Run smoke checklist + guard verification.
3. Tag v0.1.0 once smoke checklist passes.
