# Status: Overlay Infrastructure

## Summary
ADR-0001 overlay worktree contract is in place: builds relocate into `.forked-worktrees/`, reuse existing branches safely, and cherry-pick full ranges with path-bias assistance.

## Milestones
- [x] Implement sibling `.forked-worktrees/` relocation + suffixing logic
- [x] Reuse existing overlay worktrees with automated resets
- [x] Switch cherry-pick loop to full ranges + structured logging
- [ ] Document + automate smoke checklist execution in CI

## Metrics
- Coverage: overlay rebuild automation shipped; CI smoke step pending
- Confidence: high (manual smoke + reuse validation complete)

## Next Steps
1. Add CI automation for the overlay smoke checklist.
2. Capture rebuild timing/conflict metrics for release notes.
3. Monitor Git worktree edge cases across supported versions.
