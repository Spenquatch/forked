# Status: Overlay Infrastructure

## Summary
Documentation now captures the target branch/worktree architecture and smoke tests. Engineering work for [ADR-0001](../../adr/0001-overlay-worktree-contract.md) remains (relocation, reuse, logging inside `forked build`).

## Milestones
- [ ] Implement sibling `.forked-worktrees/` relocation + suffixing logic
- [ ] Reuse existing overlay worktrees with automated resets
- [ ] Switch cherry-pick loop to full ranges + structured logging
- [ ] Document + automate smoke checklist execution in CI

## Metrics
- Coverage: documentation in place; code changes outstanding
- Confidence: medium (Git edge cases still theoretical)

## Next Steps
1. Implement relocation + suffix logic and add targeted unit tests.
2. Land worktree reuse reset flow; rerun smoke checklist twice locally.
3. Update release notes with measured rebuild timing/conflict metrics.
