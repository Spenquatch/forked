# Implementation Plan

## Scope
- Align handbook planning artifacts with README requirements.
- Ensure CI pipeline instructions match local release workflow.
- Capture backlog of near-term QoL follow-ups.

## Work Breakdown
1. **Documentation Refresh**
   - [ ] Expand README smoke + release checklists with sample commands, expected output, and troubleshooting tips.
   - [ ] Cross-link ADR-0001/ADR-0002 and feature guides from README for traceability.
   - [ ] Publish updated highlights in `legacy-handbook/releases/v1.0.0.md` once engineering tasks land.
2. **Planning Artefacts**
   - [ ] Align `releases/v1.0.0/plan.md` success criteria with overlay + guard tasks, including owners and due dates.
   - [ ] Keep `releases/v1.0.0/features.yaml` in sync with feature progress increments (0/25/50/100%).
   - [ ] Refresh sprint plan/tasks whenever release scope changes; document decisions in daily status.
3. **Automation Integration**
   - [ ] Validate the GitHub Action (editable install + smoke guard run) against updated docs.
   - [ ] Document `make release-status`, `make dashboard`, and guard artefact upload flow inside the handbook.
   - [ ] Draft post-tag communication template (recipients, message outline).

## Validation
- Cross-check README checklists with sprint tasks and release plan.
- Run `make dashboard` (once automation is available) to ensure new feature entries appear.
- Confirm backlog captures follow-up items.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Planning docs drift from actual work. Mitigation: treat README checklists as acceptance criteria; keep features updated post-release.
