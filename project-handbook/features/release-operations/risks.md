# Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Planning docs fall out of sync with README checklist | Medium | Schedule review after tagging v0.1.0 |
| Release pipeline lacks automated verification | Medium | Use smoke checklist before tagging; add automation later |
| Nice-to-have backlog stalls | Low | Captured in BACKLOG.md for prioritization |
