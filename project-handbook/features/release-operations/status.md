# Status: Release Operations

## Summary
Release operations documentation has structure (architecture + validation guides), but README, release notes, and automation instructions still need aligned updates before tagging v1.0.0. Success is dependent on completing [ADR-0001](../../adr/0001-overlay-worktree-contract.md) and [ADR-0002](../../adr/0002-guard-cli-contract.md).

## Milestones
- [ ] Enhance README smoke & release checklists with concrete commands and outputs
- [ ] Sync release plan/notes with overlay + guard deliverables
- [ ] Validate CI workflow (editable install + smoke guard run) and document usage
- [ ] Prepare communications template and backlog follow-up for post-release improvements

## Next Steps
1. Capture final decision log / ADR if needed.
2. Run smoke checklist + guard verification.
3. Tag v1.0.0 once smoke checklist passes and guard artefacts archived.
