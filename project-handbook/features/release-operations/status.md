# Status: Release Operations

## Summary
Release operations documentation is now aligned with the v1.1.0 feature set: README sections cover feature slices, conflict bundles, overrides, status JSON, and the clean workflow; release notes and changelog capture the full milestone.

## Milestones
- [x] Enhance README smoke & release checklists with concrete commands and outputs
- [x] Sync release plan/notes with overlay + guard deliverables
- [ ] Validate CI workflow (editable install + smoke guard run) and document usage
- [ ] Prepare communications template and backlog follow-up for post-release improvements

## Next Steps
1. Capture final decision log / ADR if needed.
2. Run smoke checklist + guard verification.
3. Tag v1.0.0 once smoke checklist passes and guard artefacts archived.
