# Status JSON

Purpose
- Provide a machine-readable `forked status --json` output capturing upstream/trunk info, patch drift (`ahead/behind`), recent overlay selections (features, patches, build timestamps, skip counts), and guard-derived both_touched metrics.
- Feed dashboards, guard provenance, and CI workflows with stable schema (`status_version: 1`).

Outcomes
- Status command emits JSON alongside human-readable output.
- Overlay metadata is sourced from build provenance logs/notes.
- Consumers can request latest N overlays (`--latest`, default 5) for reporting.
- Downstream tooling can parse a stable schema including `selection` provenance and `both_touched_count` (nullable when guard has not yet run).

State
- Stage: in-progress
- Owner: @ai-agent

Usage
- `forked status --json | jq '.patches[] | {name, ahead, behind}'` surfaces drift across patch branches.
- `forked status --json --latest 1 | jq '.overlays[0].selection.features'` inspects the newest overlayâ€™s provenance.
- Fallback behaviour logs a warning and marks `selection.source: "derived"` when build logs/notes are unavailable.
