# Completion Checklist

- [x] Dry-run output clearly lists candidates and pending commands.
- [x] Destructive path gated behind `--no-dry-run --confirm` (explicit confirmation required).
- [x] Overlay pruning respects `--keep`, `--overlays` (age/pattern), and skips tagged/active overlays.
- [x] Worktree pruning uses Git + filesystem checks without touching active worktrees.
- [x] Conflict bundle cleanup retains most recent bundle per overlay.
- [x] Documentation updated with usage examples and safety notes.
- [x] `make validate` passes.
