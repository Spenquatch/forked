title: Feature Resolver & CLI
feature: feature-slice-workflows
decision: ADR-0003

status: done
story_points: 5
depends_on: []
prio: P0
due: 2025-10-24
acceptance:
  - Resolver selects patches via overlay profiles, feature lists, include/exclude filters while preserving global order.
  - `forked feature create` scaffolds numbered patch branches and updates `forked.yml`.
  - `forked feature status` reports slice ahead/behind counts and merged indicators.
  - `forked build --skip-upstream-equivalents` skips upstream-equivalent commits and logs counts per patch.
  - Provenance entries recorded in `.forked/logs/forked-build.log` (plus optional git notes) capture patches, features, resolver mode, commit ranges, and skip counters for downstream consumers; guard/status can fall back gracefully when notes absent.
