Highlights
- Forked CLI 1.0.0 readies overlays, guard automation, and documentation for live demos

Changes
- Overlay infrastructure guarantees: sibling worktree roots, branch reuse, full-range cherry-picks (ADR-0001)
- Guard CLI contract: deterministic exit codes, sentinel fixes, `"report_version": 1`, `--numstat` metrics (ADR-0002)
- README + CI polish: smoke/release checklists, editable install workflow, backlog capture for `forked clean` & `status --json`
