# Architectural Decision Records (Global)

Use ADRs for cross-cutting, multi-feature decisions. Feature-specific decisions belong in each feature's `fdr/` folder.

## Current ADRs

- **ADR-0001**: Overlay Worktree Contract
- **ADR-0002**: Guard CLI Contract
- **ADR-0003**: Feature Slice Workflows
- **ADR-0004**: Conflict Bundle Automation
- **ADR-0005**: Operational Tooling Enhancements

Naming & Status
- File: `0001-<slug>.md` with id `ADR-0001` in front matter
- Status: `draft | accepted | superseded | rejected`
- Supersede rules: add both `supersedes` and `superseded_by` links when applicable

## Future ADR Backlog

- P0-P4 Issue Severity Classification System (draft)

### Process & Workflow
